# Knowledge: CS50 AI Week 1 Projects

This repository contains the solutions for the Week 1 problems of the CS50 AI course, focusing on logical reasoning and knowledge representation. The two projects included are **Knights** and **Minesweeper**.

## Projects

### Knights

The Knights problem involves solving a logical puzzle using propositional logic and model checking. The puzzle involves determining the truth-tellers and liars among a group of knights.

#### Key Features
- Uses logical expressions to represent the puzzle constraints.
- Implements model checking to find the solution.
- Demonstrates practical applications of propositional logic in solving puzzles.

### Minesweeper

The Minesweeper project replicates the classic Minesweeper game using AI techniques. The AI plays the game by making safe moves and inferring the locations of mines based on the numbers revealed.

Key Features
- Implements a Minesweeper game environment.
- Uses logical inference to determine safe moves and mine locations.
- Demonstrates AI techniques in a game-playing context.
